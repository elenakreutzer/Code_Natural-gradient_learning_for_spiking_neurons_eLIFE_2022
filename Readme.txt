This repository contains the code underlying the figures in "Kreutzer,E., Petrovici, M.A., Senn, W., Natural-gradient learning for spiking neurons, eLife, 2022".

Instructions on how to run the code are given in the figure-specific readme files.

All code is programmed for python2.7. Part of the simulations must be run on a SLURM HPC CPU cluster.
